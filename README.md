# Intro of Swiss Railway Clock

Everyone know about Famous Swiss Railway Clock. By the way, Windows have Gadgets including a clock too. And this clock is almost same like Windows Clock but it’s portable and style like Swiss Railway Clock.


# Why I make this clock?

Using Windows 10 you probably not found Gadgets tab. You can install this thing via Internet but that’s not portable even it’s not much secure. To solve this problem I make this simple clock, it’s portable and also Open-Source. You can modify transparent mode, auto-start, clock-size and some more basic functions you can add or remove from it.


# Looks program written in VBA but it’s not why?

Actually this program is written using FreeBasic. In a small intro FreeBasic is a multi-platform, open-source BASIC programing language and it’s compiler available for Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, Linux, FreeBSD and Xbox. This compiler use GCC to translate it in C language and then compile it.


# How I get this Idea?

Honestly, some days ago I see this kinda image on Internet and also I remember that old Windows and some newest Windows OS doesn’t have this basic Clock so by this idea and topic I decided to start a project about this clock.

Note that: FreeBasic image is under it’s author copyrighted, you can use it under GPL v2 Terms and Conditions.


# How much I can customize it?

You can customize/modify on your own thoughts! You can add more functions or remove something whatever you want to do. By default I added some features that you can use it.

# 1. Always on Top

This thing enable this program to stay on Top of every Windows (such as: Browser, Taskbar). Note that this feature isn’t effect your gaming mode, it means it’s doesn’t give on top or issues when you gaming.

# 2. Auto-start with Windows

This settings enable to auto-start clock when you next boot. By default it’s doesn’t enabled. You can enable it from Right-Bottom menu.
If you found any problem with it that where it’s store start key, you can manually Disable or Enable it.

(Goto: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run) And delete or add SwissRailwayClock (REG_SZ) key.

# 3. Disable Movement

If your Desktop is full of files and folders like me, then this feature is helpful to lock clock at a current position even if you move / drag mouse there clock will not move it’s position. To know more it you can see demo video.

# 4. Reset position

Reset position of this you can reset the position at center of your Desktop, and move anywhere again, I add this thing because sometimes we move some things at border of Desktop and then it’s little bit difficult to out them.

By clicking on this it comes to it’s default position (0, 0) in center.


# 5. Settings tab

In settings tab you will found three more functions. It is useful if you want to make it more precious on your side.

i) Set Clock size

If you want to set clock size smaller or larger you can do it by this thing. It’s started from (0 to 788) so you can set size on how much you want.

ii) Set Clock transparency level

It will set transparency mode of this program, by default it set in 255, it means it will show like another Windows, but you can set it (from 0 to 255).

iii) Set Clock background transparency level

If you don’t want to transparent your clock but want to transparent it’s background this feature will help you. It will transparent background of clock. To know more please see this demo video.


# 6. Exit

To Exit from it click on Exit to exit.


# Supported platforms

Even FreeBasic supports Linux and FreeBSD but it’s written using WinAPI and GDIPlus functions is applied. So it’s only available for Microsoft Windows.


Thanks for using ;3
